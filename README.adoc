// =================================================================================================
// Introduction
// =================================================================================================

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to deploy two microservices in Open Liberty containers to a {kube} cluster on
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

Kubernetes is an open source container orchestrator that automates many tasks that are involved in 
deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications. If you would like to learn
more about Kubernetes, check out the https://openliberty.io/guides/kubernetes-intro.html[Deploying microservices to Kubernetes^]
guide.

There are different cloud-based solutions for running your {kube} workloads. 
With a cloud-based infrastructure, you can focus on developing your microservices 
without worrying about low-level infrastructure details for deployment. Using a cloud helps
you easily scale and manage your microservices in a high-availability setup.

Google Cloud Platform offers a managed {kube} service called Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). Using GKE simplifies the process of running Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform without 
needing to install or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. It provides a hosted {kube} 
cluster that you can deploy your microservices to. In this guide, you will use GKE with a Google
Container Registry (GCR). GCR is a private registry that is used to store 
and distribute your container images. Because GKE is hosted on Google Cloud Platform, fees might be associated with running this guide. See the official
https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/pricing[GKE pricing^] documentation for more details.

The two microservices you will deploy are called `system` and `inventory`. 
The `system` microservice returns the JVM system properties of the running container. 
It also returns the name of the pod in the HTTP header, which makes replicas easy to distinguish from each other. 
The `inventory` microservice adds the properties from the `system` microservice to the inventory. 
This demonstrates how communication can be established between pods inside a cluster.

== Additional prerequisites

Before you begin, the following tools need to be installed:

* *Google account:* To run this guide and use Google Cloud Platform, you will need a Google account. If you do not
have an account already, navigate to the 
https://accounts.google.com/signup[Google account sign-up page^] 
to create a Google account.

* *Google Cloud Platform account:* Visit the https://console.cloud.google.com/[Google Cloud Platform console^] to link your
Google account to Google Cloud Platform.

* *Google Cloud SDK - CLI:* You will need to use the `gcloud` command-line tool that is included in the https://cloud.google.com/sdk[Google Cloud SDK^]. 
See the official
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts[Cloud SDK: Command Line Interface - Quickstart^]
documentation and complete the “Before you begin” section to set up the Google Cloud Platform CLI for your platform. 
To verify that the `gcloud` tool is installed correctly, run the following command:

+
[role=command]
```
gcloud info
```

* *kubectl:* You need the Kubernetes `kubectl` command-line tool to interact with your Kubernetes cluster.
If `kubectl` is not already installed, use the Google Cloud Platform CLI to download and install `kubectl` with the following command:

+
[role=command]
```
gcloud components install kubectl
```

// =================================================================================================
// Setting up your Google Cloud project
// =================================================================================================

== Setting up your Google Cloud project

=== Initializing the Google Cloud SDK

To create a Google Cloud Project, first initialize the Google Cloud SDK by performing the `gcloud` initial setup.
The `gcloud init` command starts an interactive setup that creates or modifies configuration for `gcloud`,
such as setting the user account and specifying the project to use:

[role=command]
```
gcloud init
```

Follow the prompt to log in with your Google Cloud Platform account.
This authorizes Google Cloud SDK to access Google Cloud Platform with your account credentials.

If you have existing projects, do not use them. Instead, create a new project for this guide. If you don't have existing projects, you will be automatically prompted to create a new one.

You will need to specify a Project ID for your project.
Enter a Project ID that is unique within Google Cloud and matches the pattern that is described in the prompt.


If the Project ID is available to use, you will see the following output:

[role="no_copy"]
----
Your current project has been set to: [project-id].
...
Your Google Cloud SDK is configured and ready to use!
----

Make sure that billing is enabled for your project so that you can use its Google Cloud services.
Follow the https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project[Modify a Project's Billing Settings^]
documentation to enable billing for your Google Cloud project.

=== Enabling Google Cloud APIs for your project

To run this guide, you need to use certain Google Cloud services, such as the
`Compute Engine API`, `Cloud Build API`, and the `Kubernetes Engine API`.

You will use the `Compute Engine API` to set the default Compute Engine region and zone where the
resources for your cloud deployments will be hosted.

The `Cloud Build API` allows you to build container images and push them to a Google Container Registry. 
Your private container registry manages and stores the container images that you build in later steps.

To deploy your application to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), you will need to enable the `Kubernetes Engine API`.
The container images that you build will run on a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster.

Enable the necessary Google Cloud APIs for your project by using the `gcloud services enable` command.
To see a list of Google Cloud APIs and services that are available for your project, run the following command:

[role=command]
```
gcloud services list --available
```

You will see an output similar to the following example:

[role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                                                  TITLE
abusiveexperiencereport.googleapis.com                Abusive Experience Report API
cloudbuild.googleapis.com                             Cloud Build API
composer.googleapis.com                               Cloud Composer API
compute.googleapis.com                                Compute Engine API
computescanning.googleapis.com                        Compute Scanning API
contacts.googleapis.com                               Contacts API
container.googleapis.com                              Kubernetes Engine API
containeranalysis.googleapis.com                      Container Analysis API
containerregistry.googleapis.com                      Container Registry API
----

The `NAME` field is the value that you need to pass into the `gcloud services enable` command to enable an API.

Run the following command to enable the `Compute Engine API`, `Cloud Build API`, and `Kubernetes Engine API`:

[role=command]
```
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com container.googleapis.com
```

=== Setting the default region and zone

A Compute Engine region is a geographical location that is used to host your Compute Engine resources. 
Each region is composed of multiple zones. For example, the `asia-east1` region is divided into
multiple zones: `asia-east1-a`, `asia-east1-b`, and `asia-east1-c`.
Some resources are limited to specific regions or zones, and other resources are available across all regions.
See the
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/global-regional-zonal-resources[Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources^]
documentation for more details.

If resources are created without specifying a region or zone, 
these new resources run in the default location for your project.
The metadata for your resources are stored at this specified Google Cloud location.

Run the following command to see the list of available zones and its corresponding regions for your project:

[role=command]
```
gcloud compute zones list
```

You will see an output similar to the following example:

[role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                       REGION                   STATUS
us-west1-b                 us-west1                 UP
us-west1-c                 us-west1                 UP
us-west1-a                 us-west1                 UP
europe-west1-b             europe-west1             UP
europe-west1-d             europe-west1             UP
europe-west1-c             europe-west1             UP
asia-east1-b               asia-east1               UP
asia-east1-a               asia-east1               UP
asia-east1-c               asia-east1               UP
southamerica-east1-b       southamerica-east1       UP
southamerica-east1-c       southamerica-east1       UP
southamerica-east1-a       southamerica-east1       UP
northamerica-northeast1-a  northamerica-northeast1  UP
northamerica-northeast1-b  northamerica-northeast1  UP
northamerica-northeast1-c  northamerica-northeast1  UP
----

The `NAME` field and `REGION` field are the values that you will later substitute into `[zone]` and `[region]`.

To set the default Compute Engine region and zone, run the `gcloud config set compute` command.
Remember to replace `[region]` and `[zone]` with a region and a zone that are available for your project.
Make sure that your zone is within the region that you set.

[role=command]
```
gcloud config set compute/region [region]
gcloud config set compute/zone [zone]
```

// =================================================================================================
// Uploading images to a container registry
// =================================================================================================

== Uploading images to a container registry

The starting Java project, which you can find in the `start` directory, is a multi-module Maven
project. It is made up of the `system` and `inventory` microservices. Each microservice exists in its own directory,
`start/system` and `start/inventory`. Both of these directories contain a Dockerfile, which is necessary
for building the container images. If you're unfamiliar with Dockerfiles, check out the
https://openliberty.io/guides/containerize.html[Containerizing microservices^] guide.

Navigate to the `start` directory and run the following command:

[role=command]
```
cd start
mvn package
```

Now that your microservices are packaged, build your container images by using Google Cloud Build.
Instead of installing Docker locally to containerize your application, you can use Cloud Build's
`gcloud builds submit --tag` command to build a Docker image from a Dockerfile and push that image to a container registry. 
Cloud Build is similar to running the `docker build` and `docker push` commands.

Run the `gcloud builds submit --tag` command from the directories that contain the Dockerfiles.
You will build images for `system` and `inventory` by running the `gcloud builds submit --tag` command
from both the `start/system` and `start/inventory` directories.

Navigate to the `start/system` directory.

Build the `system` image and push it to your container registry by using Cloud Build.
Your container registry is located at `gcr.io/[project-id]`.
Replace `[project-id]` with the Project ID that you previously defined for your Google Cloud project.
To get the Project ID for your project, run the `gcloud config get-value project` command.

[role=command]
```
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/[project-id]/system:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

If the `system` image builds and pushes successfully, you will see the following output:

[role="no_copy"]
----
DONE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----

Navigate to the `start/inventory` directory.

Build the `inventory` image and push it to your container registry by using Cloud Build:

[role=command]
```
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/[project-id]/inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

You will see the following output:

[role="no_copy"]
----
DONE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----


To verify that the images are built, run the following command to list all existing container images for your project:

[role='command']
```
gcloud container images list
```

Your `system` and `inventory` images should appear in the list of all container images:

[role="no_copy"]
----
NAME
gcr.io/[project-id]/inventory
gcr.io/[project-id]/system
----

// =================================================================================================
// Provisioning a Kubernetes cluster on GKE
// =================================================================================================

== Provisioning a Kubernetes cluster on GKE

To create your GKE cluster, use the `gcloud container clusters create` command. 
When the cluster is created, the command outputs information about the cluster.
You might need to wait while your cluster is being created.

Replace `[cluster-name]` with a name that you want for your cluster.
The name for your cluster must contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters and `-`,
and must start with a letter and end with an alphanumeric character.

[role=command]
```
gcloud container clusters create [cluster-name] --num-nodes 1
```

When your cluster is successfully created, you will see the following output:

[role="no_copy"]
----
NAME            LOCATION   MASTER_VERSION  MASTER_IP     MACHINE_TYPE   NODE_VERSION    NUM_NODES  STATUS
[cluster-name]  [zone]     1.13.11-gke.23  35.203.77.52  n1-standard-1  1.13.11-gke.23  1          RUNNING
----

Since a zone was not specified in the `gcloud container clusters create` command,
your cluster was created in the default zone that you previously set in the `gcloud config set compute/zone` command.

The `--num-nodes` option creates a cluster with a certain number of nodes in the Kubernetes node pool. 
By default, if this option is excluded, three nodes are assigned to the node pool.
You created a single-node cluster since this application does not require a large amount of resources.

Run the following command to check the status of the available node in your GKE cluster:

[role=command]
```
kubectl get nodes
```

The `kubectl get nodes` command outputs information about the node.
The `STATUS` of the node is in the `Ready` state:

[role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                                           STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
gke-[cluster-name]-default-pool-be4471fe-qnl6  Ready    <none>   46s   v1.14.10-gke.17
----


// =================================================================================================
// Deploying microservices to GKE
// =================================================================================================

== Deploying microservices to GKE

Now that your container images are built and you created a Kubernetes cluster, you can deploy the images using a Kubernetes resource definition.

A Kubernetes resource definition is a `yaml` file that contains a description of all your 
deployments, services, or any other resources that you want to deploy. All resources can 
also be deleted from the cluster by using the same `yaml` file that you used to deploy them.
The [hotspot file=0]`kubernetes.yaml` resource definition file is provided for you in the `start` directory. If you are interested 
in learning more about the Kubernetes resource definition, check out the 
https://openliberty.io/guides/kubernetes-intro.html[Deploying microservices to Kubernetes^]
guide.

Navigate to the `start` directory.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Update the `kubernetes.yaml` file in the `start` directory.#
`kubernetes.yaml`
----
[role="edit_command_text"]
Replace [hotspot=sysImage hotspot=invImage file=0]`[project-id]` with your Project ID.
You can get the Project ID for your project by running the `gcloud config get-value project` command.

kubernetes.yaml
[source, Text, linenums, indent=0, role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/kubernetes.yaml[]
----

The [hotspot=sysImage hotspot=invImage file=0]`image` is the name and tag of the container image that you want 
to use for the container. The [hotspot]`kubernetes.yaml` file references the images that you pushed to your registry
for the [hotspot=sysImage file=0]`system` and [hotspot=invImage file=0]`inventory` repositories.

The service that is used to expose your deployments has a type of [hotspot=sysNodePort hotspot=invNodePort file=0]`NodePort`.
This type means you can access these services from outside of your cluster via a specific port.
You can expose your services in other ways, such as using a `LoadBalancer` service type or by using an `Ingress`.
In production, you would most likely use an `Ingress`.

=== Deploying your application

To deploy your microservices to Google Kubernetes Engine, you need Kubernetes to create
the contents of the [hotspot]`kubernetes.yaml` file.

Navigate to the `start` directory and run the following command to deploy the resources defined in the [hotspot file=0]`kubernetes.yaml` file:

[role='command']
```
kubectl apply -f kubernetes.yaml
```

You will see the following output:

[role="no_copy"]
----
deployment.apps/system-deployment created
deployment.apps/inventory-deployment created
service/system-service created
service/inventory-service created
----

Run the following command to check the status of your pods:
[role='command']
```
kubectl get pods
```

If all the pods are healthy and running, you will see an output similar to the following example:
[role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                                    READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
system-deployment-6bd97d9bf6-4ccds      1/1       Running   0          15s
inventory-deployment-645767664f-nbtd9   1/1       Running   0          15s
----

=== Making requests to the microservices

To try out your microservices, you need to allow TCP traffic on your node ports, `31000` and `32000`,
for the `system` and `inventory` microservices.

Create a firewall rule to allow TCP traffic on your node ports:

[role='command']
```
gcloud compute firewall-rules create sys-node-port --allow tcp:31000
gcloud compute firewall-rules create inv-node-port --allow tcp:32000
```

Take note of the `EXTERNAL-IP` in the output of the following command. It is the hostname that you will later substitute into `[hostname]`:

[role='command']
```
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

[role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                                  STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION           INTERNAL-IP   EXTERNAL-IP
gke-[cluster-name]-default-pool-be4   Ready    <none>   14m   v1.13.11-gke.23   10.162.0.2    35.203.106.216
----

To access your microservices, point your browser to the following URLs, substituting the appropriate `[hostname]` value:

* `{system-api}`
* `{inventory-api}`

In the first URL, you see a result in JSON format with the system properties of the container JVM.
The second URL returns an empty list, which is expected because no system properties are stored in the inventory yet. 

Point your browser to the `{inventory-api}/system-service` URL. When you visit this URL, these system
properties are automatically stored in the inventory. Go back to `{inventory-api}` and
you see a new entry for `system-service`.

// =================================================================================================
// Testing the microservices
// =================================================================================================

== Testing the microservices

A few tests are included for you to test the basic functionality of the microservices. 
If a test failure occurs, then you might have introduced a bug into the code. 
To run the tests, wait for all pods to be in the ready state before you proceed further.

pom.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/inventory/pom.xml[]
----

The default properties that are defined in the [hotspot file=0]`pom.xml` file are:

[cols="15, 100", options="header"]
|===
| *Property*                                | *Description*
| [hotspot=cluster file=0]`cluster.ip`                         | The IP or hostname for your cluster.
| [hotspot=system-service file=0]`system.kube.service`         | The name of the Kubernetes Service wrapping the `system` pods, `system-service` by default.
| [hotspot=system-node-port file=0]`system.node.port`          | The NodePort of the `system-service` Kubernetes Service, 31000 by default.
| [hotspot=inventory-node-port file=0]`inventory.node.port`    | The NodePort of the `inventory-service` Kubernetes Service, 32000 by default.
|===


=== Running the tests

Run the Maven `failsafe:integration-test` goal to test your microservices by replacing the `[hostname]`
with the value determined in the previous section.

[role='command']
```
mvn failsafe:integration-test -Dcluster.ip=[hostname]
```

If the tests pass, you will see the following output for each service:

// Tearing down the environment
// =================================================================================================

== Tearing down the environment

It is important to clean up your resources when you are finished with the guide so that you do not incur extra charges for ongoing usage.

When you no longer need your deployed microservices, you can delete all {kube} resources 
by running the `kubectl delete` command:

[role='command']
```
kubectl delete -f kubernetes.yaml
```

Delete the firewall rules for your node ports:

[role='command']
```
gcloud compute firewall-rules delete sys-node-port inv-node-port
```

Since you are done testing your cluster, clean up all of its related sources by using the `gcloud container clusters delete` command:

[role='command']
```
gcloud container clusters delete [cluster-name]
```

Remove the container images from the container registry:

[role='command']
```
gcloud container images delete gcr.io/[project-id]/system:1.0-SNAPSHOT gcr.io/[project-id]/inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

Delete your Google Cloud project:

[role='command']
```
gcloud projects delete [project-id]
```

// =================================================================================================
